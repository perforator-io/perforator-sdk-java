    **Perforator** is a load-testing platform to generate a load on websites from thousands of concurrent browsers running in the cloud and automated via selenium.
    On top of main functionality generating a load via browsers, Perforator provides a broad set of capabilities to analyze results of the load test:
    - On-demand browsers provisioning in the cloud.
    - Automatic transactions reporting.
    - Automatic RAW data capturing from all browsers started as a part of a load test.
    - Filtering and aggregation of RAW data captured.
    - Widest set of statistics calculated from RAW data.
    - Visualization via charts for every metric available.
    - Access to individual records to better understand the root cause of the performance problem.

      Projects are used to organize repeatable performance test executions related to the same environment:
      - Target website, for example, your-website.com
      - Deployment environment, for example, stage or prod
      - Performance test type, for example, load, stress, scalability, etc

      Example of good project naming: *your-website.com, stress testing in prod*.
      There are no restrictions on the project naming, so feel free to choose any name which can identify the purpose of repeatable performance test executions.

      Execution is a container of the data and compute resources related to a single performance test run.
      All executions are created within the parent project.
      Usually, when a new performance test starts, it should create a new execution record, request browser clouds within such execution, and begin streaming performance-related events.
      Allocating compute resources is done within browser clouds belonging to given execution - for more details, please see section "Browser Clouds".
      By default, when execution is created, its name is equal to its key, but feel free to adjust the name to anything more meaningful for you.
      You can utilize notes of the execution if you have any special conditions or instructions that might help you understand in the future behavior or purpose of the test execution.

    description: |
      Browser Cloud is a container of compute resources(browsers) allocated for a performance test run.
      All browser clouds are created within parent execution.
      Browser cloud is [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev) compatible, and access to provisioned browsers is provided via [WebDriver W3C Protocol](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/).
      Once the browser cloud is created on-demand and becomes operational, it can be accessed via a dedicated selenium hub URL.
      Once browser cloud is terminated, all compute resources are destroyed, and you can't access the selenium hub URL anymore.

      Essential characteristics of the browser cloud is `concurrency`:
      - `concurrency` - how many **concurrent** browser sessions you would like to have in the cloud at any given moment.

      Please keep in mind that you can create as many **concurrent** WebDriver sessions as requested via `concurrency`.
      For example, if you created a browser cloud with concurrency 200, then established 200 active WebDriver sessions, and then you try to create one(or more) session on top of **currently active** 200 sessions - such request will be rejected and returned with an error.
      At the same time, `concurrency` is not a limitation of how many WebDriver sessions can be created **overall**. For example, if your average WebDriver session duration is 1 minute and you have concurrency = 200, then you will have ~ `60 X 200 = 12000` unique sessions during the hour.
      Once any WebDriver session is terminated, its allocation slot becomes available to create a brand new browser session.
      If the WebDriver session is not accessed during any 60 seconds interval and not [terminated](https://www.selenium.dev/selenium/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/remote/RemoteWebDriver.html#quit()) manually - it is destroyed automatically, and its slot becomes available for creating new sessions again.
      ***
      **Browsers**:
      - We are running **Chrome** browsers in the cloud so that the **Chrome** browser will back all WebDriver sessions.
      - Browsers are started in *headful* mode, so all the visited pages in the browser are fully rendered, and you can even take [Screenshots](https://www.selenium.dev/selenium/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/remote/RemoteWebDriver.html#getScreenshotAs(org.openqa.selenium.OutputType))
      - The default resolution of the browser is 1920x1080, but you can easily resize it to whatever resolution is more suitable for you.
      - Every browser receives one dedicated CPU core and 1GB of RAM.
      - All the networking data on the HTTP request level from running browsers is automatically captured behind the scenes and submitted for analytical processing.
      - Additionally to capturing every HTTP request, we are automatically capturing all important page events like:
        - [Page DOM Content Time](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/tot/Page/#event-domContentEventFired)
        - [Page Load Time](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/tot/Page/#event-loadEventFired)
        - Page Duration, i.e., how much time the browser was active on the specific page.
      - Please refer to the [Analytics](#/Analytics) section to see more details on which data we are capturing and what kind of statistics is computed from such data.
      ***
      **Geographic location**:
      Browser clouds are launched in US-based data centers, and all browsers are evenly spread across regions below.
      For example, if you are requesting a browser cloud with 1000 browsers, every region will get ~250 browsers.
      - North Virginia
      - Ohio
      - North California
      - Oregon
      ***
      **On-Demand provisioning flow**:
      1. Once a browser cloud record is created, it automatically receives `QUEUED` status.
      2. Browser cloud stays in `QUEUED` state until infrastructure has enough CPU & RAM capacity to provision requested browsers. All the requests from all different clients to create browser clouds are processed in [FIFO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFO_(computing_and_electronics)) order.
      3. Once the infrastructure has enough hardware capacity to create all requested browsers, the browser cloud is moved to a `PROVISIONING` state.
      4. `PROVISIONING` state is kept while all VMs are starting. Usually, it takes 2-3 minutes for smaller clouds and up to 10 minutes for large clouds with 5k+ browsers.
      5. Browser cloud is moved to `OPERATIONAL` state once all VMs have successfully started and passed all required health checks.
      6. If the user requests termination of the browser cloud, the browser cloud is moved to `TERMINATING` state. Such a state is used as an indicator that decommissioning of the resources has begun.
      7. The final state of the browser cloud is `TERMINATED` - it indicates that all resources allocated to the browser cloud have been successfully deleted.
      ***
      **[1-to-N](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-to-many_(data_model)) relationship between Execution and Browser Clouds**:
      - In the majority of the cases, there is a 1-to-1 relationship between execution and browser cloud.
      - One browser cloud is created per one load generator, where a single load generator covers concurrent execution of 1 or more performance testing suites.
      - More than one browser cloud is usually a case when you need to run multiple load generators in parallel but combine all analytical data to get a 360 view of the results.
      ***
      **Limitations**:
      - Browser cloud concurrency can't exceed concurrency limits applied on your account.
      - Browser cloud duration can't exceed duration limits applied on your account.
      - To check the current limits applied on your account, please see [Limits](#/Limits) documentation.
      - To increase such limits - please send us an email at support@perforator.io and describe your use case. We will be pleased to expand the boundaries in reasonable ranges.

  - name: Cloud runners
    description: |
      In certain cases, you might not have enough hardware capacity or 
      network bandwidth to launch a load-generator locally. 
      For example, starting a load-generator orchestrating 5k remote browsers 
      requires at least 20 CPU cores and 20 GB memory.  
      To cover such a big load test, you can spin up a cloud runner within 
      the Perforator platform and access it via SSH protocol.  
      Currently, all cloud runners are launched in **AWS US-EAST-1** region only to be 
      located as close as possible to the Perforator platform infrastructure.  
      ***
      Perforator supports the following cloud runner types:

  - name: Analytics
    description: |
      Executing a load test is just a first step in understanding the overall performance of the target system.
      Equally significant, even if not more important, is to analyze the performance test results - understand bottlenecks, find the root cause, and get a 360 view of the system behavior under the load.
      Perforator covers both aspects of such tests - generating the load on a target system and query performance metrics.
      You can use *Analytics* endpoints to get performance metrics produced as a part of the performance test.
      ***
      Analytics endpoints are bound to execution scope.
      In the majority of the cases, you will have one browser cloud per execution. Still, for some complex scenarios, it is required to provision more than one browser cloud per execution and calculate performance metrics as a whole.
      ***
      All performance metrics are grouped into dedicated namespaces for more straightforward calculations and management.
      Example namespaces:
      - **requests** - HTTP requests are automatically captured from browsers launched in the cloud. We provide HTTP request metrics in both aggregated ways and on the individual level. So, you can get statistics of all HTTP requests matching given criteria or review RAW data of individual requests.
      - **pages** - all web page navigations are automatically captured from browsers launched in the cloud. You can review both aggregated metrics calculated from pages matching given criteria or review individual pages to get a clue of what was happening during a specific page visit.
      - **transactions** - this is a special concept of capturing performance metrics outside the browser cloud as it occurs inside the load-generator(where user-level code is executed). Transactions always have a start time, finish time, and success indicator - either true or false. In case of failure, the transaction also has error details attached to the record. The majority of the transactions are captured automatically as a part of the prebuilt [integrations](https://gitlab.com/perforator-public/java-tools), but you can also initiate your own transactions. Transactions can be reviewed in both aggregated ways and on an individual level.
      - **pulse** - this is a unique namespace with the primary purpose of calculating and visualizing ongoing or real-time metrics without waiting till a specific transaction/session/page is completed. You can treat the pulse namespace as a heartbeat diagram. For example, whenever any transaction/session/page is started - the system automatically omits heartbeat events every 250ms till the completion of the sequence. As a result, you can visualize how many concurrent transactions/requests/pages were happening at any given moment. In the majority of the cases, such namespace is used to calculate concurrency-related data and display it on the chart canvas.
      ***
      **Fields**
      Every namespace is composited from a set(thousands or even 100M+ for large browser clouds) of records having the same structure.
      The structure of such records is defined via a set of fields - all records within the same namespace have the same set of fields, but records from different namespaces have a different set of fields.
      Fields are needed to store information of the individual records or to filter multiple records when calculating aggregated statistics.
      Every field has its own predefined type like `string`, `boolean`, `long`, `decimal`, or `array`.
      Also, every field definition has a dedicated set of filters available to be applied when querying the data.
      ***
      **Filters**
      You can apply filters whenever you are querying for individual records or calculating aggregated metrics across a set of records.
      All filters are combined using the' AND' operator if you have multiple filters applied to your analytics request.
      In some rare cases, you might need to have a filter checking for multiple values using the 'OR' operator - in this case, you can supply filter in the form below:
      `{"field": "field_name", "condition": "=", "value": "value1 || value2 || value3" }`, where '||' acts as 'OR' operator.
      ***
      **Metrics**
      Whenever performance test runs, we capture and store source records as is(i.e., raw data) and calculate aggregated metrics from such source records in real-time.
      It allows you to calculate very complex metrics, both postfactum when the performance test is completed or still in progress.
      As a result, you don't need to think about how metrics should be pre-aggregated before performance test launches.
      Simplified flow of metrics calculation:
      - Save source records when performance test runs.
      - Extract source records when metrics calculation is requested.
      - Apply filters to extracted source records.
      - Apply math formulas to calculate aggregated metrics from filtered records.
      ***
      All analytical API calls require a massive amount of data to be extracted(millions of source records taking GBs of data in compressed format), so such calls take an extended time for processing.
      Please expect something in the 10s-30s time range to calculate your requested metrics.
      You can request one or more metrics within a single API call.
      It is preferable to request various metrics within a single API call instead of sending multiple API calls to get individual metrics separately.
      Calculating multiple metrics within a single API call takes almost the same time as calculating a single metric.
      For example, if your request to get a single metric takes 15s and you need four different metrics - it will take 15x4=60s overall, making four individual API calls, while requesting all four metrics within one call still takes 15s overall.

    description: |
      Launching browser clouds requires a tremendous amount of hardware resources to be provisioned.
      For example, a browser cloud with 10,000 concurrent browsers requires 10,000 CPU Cores and 10 TB RAM.
      Multiply this number on concurrent clients, and it might end up with unrealistic numbers.
      Unfortunately, there is no such concept as indefinite hardware resources in the real world - even major cloud providers like AWS, GCP, or Microsoft Azure have limited resources.
      As a result, to prevent system overload and provide equal capacity to all Perforator clients, we have to apply certain limits.
      Also, another critical aspect of having account-level limits - we have seen many cases where users start launching huge browser clouds from the very beginning, which immediately breaks target systems user verifies.
      A better practice is to start with the smaller browser clouds and increase the load once you verify that your system can handle even smaller-level traffic.
      Default limits are pretty conservative, but you can increase them once you hit the boundaries - please shoot us an email at support@perforator.io to increase the limits applied on your account.
      Usually, limits increase takes a few days, so please consider it before running load tests with extended capacity.

      summary: Create a new browser cloud for the given execution
      description: |
        Call this operation if you want to create a new browser cloud within the given execution.
        ***
        **Special Notes**:
        - `uuid` is a system-level field, so it will be ignored even if you try to submit it.
        - `createdAt` is a system-level field, so it will be ignored even if you try to submit it.
        - `updatedAt` is a system-level field, so it will be ignored even if you try to submit it.
        - `status` is a system-level field, so it will be ignored even if you try to submit it.
        - The platform automatically assigns random public IP addresses when creating a browser cloud, and such IPs are not known in advance. Please set `usePreAllocatedIPs` parameter to `true` if you would like all browsers to have preallocated IPs, for example, to establish network trust on your firewall side.
        - It might be a case when you need to exclude certain HTTP requests from capturing by cloud-based browsers so such requests don't affect analytics. Feel free to supply an optional parameter `dataCapturingExcludes` with the list of URLs to exclude from capturing.
        - You can supply an optional field 'httpHeaders', and as a result, all browsers from the cloud will include such headers in every HTTP request.
        - Please set `hosts` parameter if you would like to propagate additional /etc/hosts to remote browsers. It might be a case where a target website domain name is not resolvable via public DNS servers. So, to reach such domains from the browsers started in the cloud, you can supply a map of additional DNS records via 'hosts' parameter, for example: example.com => 1.2.3.4
        - Please set `dataCapturingIncludeRequestHeaders` parameter to control capturing of http requests headers. Default is `true`.
        - Please set `dataCapturingIncludeRequestBody` parameter to control capturing of http requests body. Default is `true`.
        - Please set `dataCapturingIncludeResponseHeaders` parameter to control capturing of http responses headers. Default is `true`.
        - Please set `dataCapturingIncludeResponseBody` parameter to control capturing of http responses body. Default is `true`.

        - Browser clouds
      summary: Send events for analytics
      description: |
        Call this operation if you want to submit analytics events from the load-generator side.
        ***
        **Special notes**:
        - In the majority of the cases, you don't need to call this operation manually since Perforator provides pre-build integrations that automatically submit analytics events for processing.
        - One of the pre-built integrations allows you to utilize the full power of [TestNG](https://testng.org/) paired with Perforator. Feel free to explore such integration in the [Perforator public GitLab repo](https://gitlab.com/perforator-public/java-tools/-/tree/master/testng).
        ***
        **Event Types**:
        Only the following event types(`eventType`) are allowed to be submitted:
        - `transaction_heartbeat` - event describing that specific transaction is still alive. Typically such events are submitted every 250ms for every active transaction.
        - `transaction_completed` - event describing that specific transaction has been completed. Events with such type should only be sent once when the transaction is completed.
        - `concurrency` - event describing that record should be treated as reporting point for concurrency. Typically such events are submitted every 250ms.
        ***
        **Concurrency Types**:
        Only the following concurrency types(`concurrencyType`) are allowed to be submitted:
        - `concurrent_top_level_transactions` - type of concurrency describing how many active 'top level' transactions at the specific moment.
        - `concurrent_nested_transactions` - type of concurrency describing how many active 'nested level' transactions at the specific moment.
        - `concurrent_transactions` - type of concurrency describing how many active transactions at the specific moment.
        - `concurrent_sessions` - type of concurrency describing how many active sessions at the specific moment.
        ***
        **Processing flow**:
        When the list of events is accepted, it is first validated and then placed in the async processing queue, meaning that such events will be processed eventually in the future.
        Usually, it takes around 15 seconds to process all new events.
        Operation responds with the payload containing two extra fields:
        - `rejectedEvents` - events in this collection indicate that it is not valid and should not be submitted again. Typically such events don't contain required fields or have invalid data.
        - `retryableEvents` - events in this collection are valid ones, but a technical issue occurred while submitting such events to the processing queue. Such events should be resent during the next attempt.

        All events which are neither inside `rejectedEvents` nor inside `retryableEvents` are submitted to the processing queue successfully.
        ***
        **Validations**:
        - `timestamp` - required, its value can't be in the future and can't be more than 24h back in the past.
        - `eventType` - required, should be one of 'transaction_heartbeat', 'transaction_completed' or 'concurrency'.
        - `failureMessage` - optional, but if present, it should have less than 65K symbols.
        - `failed` - should be provided for `transaction_completed` events.
        - `suiteName` - required only if eventType == 'transaction_heartbeat' or eventType == 'transaction_completed'
        - `transactionID` - required only if eventType == 'transaction_heartbeat' or eventType == 'transaction_completed', should be in [UUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) format.
        - `transactionName` - required only if eventType == 'transaction_heartbeat' or eventType == 'transaction_completed', should be less than 1024 symbols.
        - `parentTransactionID` - optional, but if present, it should be in [UUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) format.
        - `parentTransactionName` - optional, but should be provided if `parentTransactionID` is present.
        - `browserName` - optional, but if present, it should be less than 256 symbols.
        - `browserVersion` - optional, but if present, it should be less than 256 symbols.
        - `sessionId` - optional, but if present, it should be less than 64 symbols.
        - `concurrencyType` - required only if eventType == 'concurrency', should be one of 'concurrent_top_level_transactions', 'concurrent_nested_transactions', 'concurrent_transactions' or 'concurrent_sessions'.
        - `concurrencyValue` - required only if eventType == 'concurrency'.

      summary: List analytics namespaces

        Call this operation if you want to get a list of analytics namespaces available for the given project/execution.
        ***
        **Namespace** is a container storing data captured as a part of the performance test in a predefined format.
        Every namespace is characterized via a predefined set of fields describing the structure of the stored data and a set of named metrics declaring math aggregations available for analysis.
        In the majority of the cases, all projects and executions have the same namespaces/fields/metrics, but during the time, new executions can store additional data.
        As a result, older executions might have a smaller set of namespaces/fields/metrics comparing the most recent ones.
        So, please call this operation to get the detailed listing of namespaces available for the given execution.
        Here is the list of namespaces available as of now:
        - **requests** - HTTP requests are automatically captured from browsers launched in the cloud. We provide HTTP request metrics in both aggregated ways and on the individual level. So, you can get statistics of all HTTP requests matching given criteria or review RAW data of individual requests.
        - **pages** - all web page navigations are automatically captured from browsers launched in the cloud. You can review both aggregated metrics calculated from pages matching given criteria or review individual pages to get a clue of what was happening during a specific page visit.
        - **transactions** - this is a special concept of capturing performance metrics outside the browser cloud as it occurs inside the load-generator(where user-level code is executed). Transactions always have a start time, finish time, and success indicator - either true or false. In case of failure, the transaction also has error details attached to the record. The majority of the transactions are captured automatically as a part of the prebuilt [integrations](https://gitlab.com/perforator-public/java-tools), but you can also initiate your own transactions. Transactions can be reviewed in both aggregated ways and on an individual level.
        - **pulse** - this is a unique namespace with the primary purpose of calculating and visualizing ongoing or real-time metrics without waiting till a specific transaction/session/page is completed. You can treat the pulse namespace as a heartbeat diagram. For example, whenever any transaction/session/page is started - the system automatically omits heartbeat events every 250ms till the completion of the sequence. As a result, you can visualize how many concurrent transactions/sessions/pages were happening at any given moment. In the majority of the cases, such namespace is used to calculate concurrency-related data and display it on the chart canvas.

        Call this operation if you want to get a list of fields available for the given analytics namespace.
        ***
        Every field has the following characteristics:
        - `name` - the name of the field
        - `type` - the field type, for example, `string`, `boolean`, `array`, `long`, or `decimal`.
        - `filters` - an array of filters available for the given field. Such filters can be applied when filtering source records.
        - `items` - optional map describing nested structure of the field. Currently it is available only for array fields and the only example is `browser_sessions` field from `transactions` namespace: `{"browser_name": "string","browser_version": "string","session_id": "string"}`
        - `groupingFlags` - optional array describing additional flags applicable for the field during [getGroupedStatistics](#/Analytics/getGroupedStatistics) API call. Currently, we support only one grouping flag, `ignore_url_params`, which strips all URL parameters during the grouping phase, and such flag is available only for the following fields:
          - `request_url` from `requests` namespace, for example: `{"request_url": {"ignore_url_params": true}}`
          - `page_url` from `requests` namespace, for example: `{"page_url": {"ignore_url_params": true}}`
          - `page_url` from `pages` namespace, for example: `{"page_url": {"ignore_url_params": true}}`

        ***
        **Metrics** are quantitative measurements of the data captured as a part of the performance test.
        In other words, metrics can be treated as [aggregation functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggregate_function) producing a summary result from all captured/filtered records.
        Good examples of general metrics are:
        - count - counts all the records passed to aggregation.
        - min - the minimum value of a specific field from all the records passed to aggregation.
        - avg - average value of a specific field from all the records passed to aggregation.
        - max - maximum value of a specific field from all the records passed to aggregation.
        - p50, p75, p90, ..., p99 - N-th percentile calculated from a specific field of all records passed to aggregation.
        - etc
        ***
        Practical examples of metrics:
        - `duration_p90` in `requests` namespace - 90th percentile of requests duration, or in other words, 90% of all captured/filtered requests finished within a calculated value.
        - `page_load_avg` in `pages` namespace - average page load time of web pages captured/filtered. Every page load spans a time starting from the initiation phase(clicking on the link or navigating by exact URL) till the complete load of the page, including all its internal resources(css/js/images) loading and initialization.
        - `dom_content_load_sd` in `pages` namespace - [standard deviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation) of [loading page document](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/DOMContentLoaded_event) across all captured/filtered pages.
        - `status_failed_count` in `transactions` namespace - how many transactions are failed.

        **Note**: the examples above are just a tiny subset of all metrics available in the system.

      summary: Calculate data for charts in a format suitable for rendering on the canvas.
      description: |
        Call this operation if you need to aggregate analytics data in a format suitable for rendering charts on the canvas.
        ***
        You can request charts data to be calculated for one or more namespaces within a single API call, where each namespace can have its own filters and a set of metrics for aggregation.
        The precision of the chart or a time step between data points on the chart is controlled via granularity parameter.
        ***
        **Parameters**
        - `granularity` - required parameter controlling precision or time step between data points on the chart, for example, `ONE_SECOND`, `FIVE_SECONDS`, `TEN_SECONDS`, `FIFTEEN_SECONDS`, `THIRTY_SECONDS`, `ONE_MINUTE`, `FIVE_MINUTES`.
        - `namespace` - required parameter, the name of the namespace where to get source records for aggregation, for example, `requests`, `pages`, `transactions`, `pulse`.
        - `filters` - optional, an array of filters to be applied on source records before aggregation starts, for example, `[{"field": "field_name", "condition": "=", "value": "value1 || value2 || value3" }]`
        - `metrics` - required, an array of aggregation metrics to be calculated for the chart from filtered namespace records, for example, `["count", "duration_p50", "duration_p95"]`

      summary: Calculate aggregated metrics grouped by a specific field.
      description: |
        Call this operation if you need to aggregate metrics grouped by a specific field.
        The primary purpose of this operation is to provide grouping and aggregation similar to [Group By](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_by_(SQL)) SQL statement.
        A good example of such an API call is when you need to calculate HTTP requests duration grouped by `request_url` and get a table with results like below:
        |    Request URL   |  Count | Duration(p50) | Duration(p90) |
        |------------------|--------|---------------|---------------|
        |  https://a.a/a   | 23,000 |     1,278     |     2,396     |
        |  https://b.b/b   | 13,000 |     2,196     |     3,512     |
        |  https://c.c/c   | 10,000 |     5,789     |     7,987     |
        ***
        **Parameters**
        - `namespace` - required parameter, the name of the namespace where to get source records for aggregation, for example, `requests`, `pages`, `transactions`.
        - `filters` - optional, an array of filters to be applied on source records before aggregation starts, for example, `[{"field": "field_name", "condition": "=", "value": "value1 || value2 || value3" }]`
        - `metrics` - required, an array of aggregation metrics to be calculated, for example, `["count", "duration_p50", "duration_p95"]`
        - `groupBy` - required, an array of fields to apply grouping on, for example, `["request_url", "request_method"]`
        - `orderBy` - optional, an array of fields or metrics to be used when soring results, for example: `["request_url", "duration_p95"]`
        - `orderDirection` - optional field describing the direction of the results sorting with the possible values `asc`(ascending) and `desc`(descending)
        - `groupingFlags` - optional map describing special instructions to apply on groupBy fields. Currently, we support only one grouping flag, `ignore_url_params`, which strips all URL parameters during the grouping phase, and such flag is available only for the following fields:
          - `request_url` from `requests` namespace, for example: `{"request_url": {"ignore_url_params": true}}`
          - `page_url` from `requests` namespace, for example: `{"page_url": {"ignore_url_params": true}}`
          - `page_url` from `pages` namespace, for example: `{"page_url": {"ignore_url_params": true}}`

      summary: Calculate aggregated metrics
      description: |
        Call this operation if you want to calculate aggregated metrics across one or more analytical namespaces within given project/execution.
        ***
        **Parameters**
        - `namespace` - required parameter, the name of the namespace where to get source records for aggregation, for example, `requests`, `pages`, `transactions`.
        - `filters` - optional, an array of filters to be applied on source records before aggregation starts, for example, `[{"field": "field_name", "condition": "=", "value": "value1 || value2 || value3" }]`
        - `metrics` - required, an array of aggregation metrics to be calculated, for example, `["count", "duration_p50", "duration_p95"]`
        ***
        **Processing flow**
        - Extract source records when metrics calculation is requested.
        - Apply filters to extracted source records - this step is optional and only considered when filters are present.
        - Apply math formulas to calculate aggregated metrics from filtered records.
        ***
        All analytical API calls require a massive amount of data to be extracted(millions of source records taking GBs of data in compressed format), so such calls take an extended time for processing.
        Please expect something in the 10s-30s time range to calculate your requested metrics.
        You can request one or more metrics within a single API call.
        It is preferable to request various metrics within a single API call instead of making multiple API calls to get individual metrics separately.
        Calculating multiple metrics within a single API call takes almost the same time as calculating a single metric.
        For example, if your request to get a single metric takes 15s and you need four metrics - it will take 15x4=60s overall, making four individual API calls, while requesting all four metrics within one call still takes 15s overall.
        ***
        **Limits**
        You can request as many as 512 different metrics to be calculated across all namespaces within a single API call.
        API error will be returned if such a limit is violated.

      summary: Extract individual records
      description: |
        Call this operation if you want to extract individual records for the given project/execution/namespace.
        ***
        **Processing flow**
        - Extract source records for the given project/execution/namespace.
        - Apply filters to extracted source records - this step is optional and only considered when filters are present.
        - Sort filtered records according to order field(s) and order direction.
        - Return up to 100 top records.
        ***
        **Request payload parameters**
        - `namespace` - required parameter, the name of the namespace where to get source records, for example, `requests`, `pages`, `transactions`.
        - `filters` - optional, an array of filters to be applied on source records, for example, `[{"field": "field_name", "condition": "=", "value": "value1 || value2 || value3" }]`.
        - `fields` - required, an array of fields to be extracted for the source records. Unfortunately, you can't request all or wildcard fields to be extracted. Please refer to [fields](#/Analytics/getNamespaceFields) endpoint to get a complete list of available fields.
        - `orderBy` - optional, an array of field names to be used when sorting results, for example, `["request_url", "duration"]`
        - `orderDirection` - optional field describing the direction of the results sorting with the possible values `asc`(ascending) and `desc`(descending)

      description: |
        Call this operation if you would like to get current limits applied to your account.
        For example, the following limits are currently in place:
        - `UTILIZATION_DAILY_SOFT_LIMIT` - soft limit of utilizing cloud resources daily. You are allowed to launch new cloud resources before reaching this daily threshold.
        - `UTILIZATION_DAILY_HARD_LIMIT` - hard limit of utilizing cloud resources daily. All active cloud resources will be automatically terminated once you reach this daily threshold.
        - `UTILIZATION_WEEKLY_SOFT_LIMIT` - soft limit of utilizing cloud resources weekly. You are allowed to launch new cloud resources before reaching this weekly threshold.
        - `UTILIZATION_WEEKLY_HARD_LIMIT` - hard limit of utilizing cloud resources weekly. All active cloud resources will be automatically terminated once you reach this weekly threshold.  
        - `UTILIZATION_30_DAYS_SOFT_LIMIT` - soft limit of utilizing cloud resources during thirty days period. You are allowed to launch new cloud resources before reaching this thirty day threshold.
        - `UTILIZATION_30_DAYS_HARD_LIMIT` - hard limit of utilizing cloud resources during thirty days period. All active cloud resources will be automatically terminated once you reach this thirty day threshold.    
        - `CONCURRENT_BROWSER_CLOUDS` - how many concurrent browser clouds you can launch at any given moment. Only active browser clouds are counted as a part of this limit verification. The default limit is **one** browser cloud.
        - `CONCURRENT_BROWSERS` - how many concurrent browsers you can requests across all active browser clouds at any given moment. The default limit is **500** browsers.
        - `BROWSER_CLOUD_DURATION_HOURS` - what is the maximum duration(in hours) for any requested browser cloud. The default limit is **4** hours.
        - `CONCURRENT_CLOUD_RUNNERS` - how many concurrent cloud runners you can launch at any given moment. Only active cloud runners are counted as a part of this limit verification. The default limit is **one** cloud runner.
        - `CONCURRENT_CLOUD_RUNNER_CPU_CORES` - how many concurrent CPU cores you can requests across all active cloud runners at any given moment. The default limit is **8** CPU cores.
        - `CLOUD_RUNNER_DURATION_HOURS` - what is the maximum duration(in hours) for any requested cloud runner. The default limit is **4** hours.
        ***
        Please keep in mind that all the limits are adjustable, so if your current limits are not enough for your performance test requirements - please request limits increase via sending an email to support@perforator.io
